&emsp; &ensp; reducing manual effort and improving scalability.  


### üñ•Ô∏è Computer Vision Pipeline for Early Detection of Unhealthy Beef Cattle  
&emsp; - Developing a computer vision-based pipeline for the early detection of unhealthy individuals in beef cattle.  
&emsp; - The pipeline includes animal detection, segmentation, identification, tracking, and  
&emsp; &ensp; uactivity recognition to monitor cattle and build activity profiles.  


### üñ•Ô∏è Enhancing Training Stability in CLIP Models by Combining Current and Previous Loss  
&emsp; - Proposed a combined loss approach that blends current and previous losses using a specified ratio,  
&emsp; &ensp; ureducing optimization fluctuations and smoothing the loss trajectory.  
&emsp; - Demonstrated consistent performance improvements in retrieval and zero-shot prediction tasks of the CLIP model.  

### üñ•Ô∏è Cotton yield prediction and Visulization
**Research Assistant** &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; *Feb 2024 ‚Äì Aug 2024*
